# MicevViz2018

This repository contains the code for the updated version of the original program which can be found here: https://github.com/parkercode/mice-visualization

This program has additional behavior visualization options separate from the original project. This program remains in development as the professors conducting the research on the mice test subjects determine new ways they want their data to be modeled.
